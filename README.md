# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Power Bi Project
The Project that I have worked upon is "Customer - Churn". 

As part of this project, I have imported the Data from a Case study exercise in #datacamp and then, 

1. Transformed the data 
2. Analyzed the data set to pick important KPI's 
3. Created Measures and Calculated Columns through DAX 
4. Developed Reports and 
5. Finally created Dashboards from the previous reports

The Project workspace consists of 17 pages out of which the first 13 pages consist of data analysis and the last 4 pages were Final Dashboards built upon the initial 13 pages. 
They are 

1. **Pg.no 14. Overview** – This Dashboard gives Insights on several reasons that were accountable for the Loss or the Churn of customers and also the percentage of Churn rate in the individual states of the United States. 
2. **Pg.no 15. Age and Group** - This Dashboard gives Insights on the churn rate, for the Age demographic of customers, how long they have been with the Service Provider I.e., the Age of their Account, and Churn rates between Individual and Group Subscriptions. 
3. **Pg.no 16. Extra Charges** - This Dashboard gives Insights on various Extra charges such as international plans, Data Charges that are responsible for the churn of customers and it also gives insights about the payment methods that were responsible for high customer service calls between Yearly and Monthly Categories. 
4. **Pg.no 17. Final Insights** – This Dashboard reveals some of the very interesting insights like, although we observe the use of customer services is high for churner states, California is one of a kind, where there were very few customer calls, despite the high churn rate.
